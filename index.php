        <!-- programming -->
        <h3 class='narrow'>PROGRAMMING</h3>
        <p> As part of my degree course, including the Foundation Year, I  have used many coding languages 
            extensively including C, HTML5, CSS3.
            During the second year, I have also started using XML, PHP and JavaScript. 
            Examples of code that I have written can be found on my repositories on GitHub and 
            were all assignments for my degree.
            I achieved a First for all of these projects and further information on these can 
            also be found on my website.
            During the third year, the majority of programming was for my main project and involved 
            using PHP, HTML 5, CSS3, SQL and JavaScript.
            The Advanced Topics in Web Development module increases my knowledge and skills in these 
            technologies, 
            as well as using XML and understanding more theory about web services and architecture.

        <!-- problem solving -->
        <h3 class='narrow'>PROBLEM SOLVING</h3>
        <p> As a programmer, I have a lot of experience of problem solving as a big part of coding is 
            learning to solve puzzles and fix problems.
            A recent example of when I have had to solve a problem is in the website I created for the 
            Web Design Principles module in my Second Year.
            I applied a parallax effect for my background and used Firefox to design the site.
            However, when I tested the site using Chrome, the parallax effect did not work due to Chrome 
            not supporting a vital attribute in the CSS.
            I researched this issue and found several reported solutions which I tried until one of them worked.
            As a result, the website now works in Chrome and Firefox, which can be viewed on my website.

        <!-- idea to final product -->
        <h3 class='narrow'>IDEA TO FINAL PRODUCT</h3>
        <p> In my first and second years I was given assignments which required creating a website 
            from design to development.
            The majority of my third year was spent on a creative technologies project where I chose to 
            research, design and develop a mobile salon management web application.
            This involved user research, testing and evaluation, creating wireframes, static and interactive 
            mockups and then researching the technologies required to implement the design and functionality.
            These projects can be accessed at michelleabbasipour.com

            me and I chose to create a mobile web app which will allow clients to book appointments with businesses

            businesses such as appointments, clients, their business profile, treatments and employees. The web app
