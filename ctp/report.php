        <span class="text-justified">
            <p> 
                This report is going to detail the design, development and implementation of the prototype website which provides management assistance to mobile beauty businesses. 
                The website enables professionals in the beauty industry to set up and maintain a business profile, and to add the treatments they provide to this profile. 
                Clients can then book appointment slots for those treatments, as well as create their own profile and maintain the content of this.
            </p><br>
            
            <p>
                There is a registration system for both sets of users, which also enables them to login and logout, as well as to keep their details on the system database.
                There is much more functionality planned for further development of the product, but this is the first prototype and so only contains the most important requirements as per those identified by the user in the research.
                Research has been conducted with potential users in order to identify their requirements and continuous reflection and research has been undertaken throughout the project in order to ensure that these requirements are met. 
                Primary research involved sending out surveys, creating personae and scenarios and holding an online focus group,  as well as secondary research using offline and online resources.
            </p><br>
            
            <p>
                The research and findings  are discussed more fully in section four and five of this report, but were extremely beneficial in focussing on the users’ needs and enabled a list of requirements to be compiled in order of importance to the user.
                Once the first prototype was completed, this was sent for user testing and additional development was carried out to amend the website according to the results of this first user test exercise which highlighted a few issues which could be changed to benefit the user, but the majority of queries from participants was the dummy data in the database.
            </p><br>   
                
            <p>
                In terms of technology, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL have all been used to create the functionality of this website, which is a mobile-first web app. 
                Previous skills and experience provided a good foundation for building this app, further research and learning was undertaken throughout the implementation of this prototype in order to provide the functionality required. 
                Research and some design prototypes have been completed with regards to the design of the project, but the focus at this stage has been more on the functionality in order to meet users’ needs.
